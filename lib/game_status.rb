=begin #won
Simply return the index of the winning combo
We have win combos
we have a current board
we need to iterate into each win combo one by one
each iterated win combo has 3 indexes. We need to iterate each index number
each iterated number (2nd iteration) to see if it is taken with the position take method
use && operator method to see if all three indexes pass (true) the position taken method
if true. return the indexes of winning combo
else, continue to iterate
