#I need to have an array (board) that represents an empty board.

#I need a nested array, where at each index I have a winning combination.  (8 combinations)

#I need a method (win) that will take in the empty board array.
#This method should iterate through the winning combinations nested array. I want to take each index and capture that value to see if the board array has each certain combination of winning sets, then output the appropriate message. If none of those combinations are present, output false or nil.
